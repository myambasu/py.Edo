In this project, our team explored the practical application of Python programming to control the e.DO 6-axis robotic arm, a modular and open-source robot platform developed for educational and research use. Our primary goal was to design and implement a functional pick-and-place system using the e.DO robot, supported by a custom-built graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate easier human-robot interaction. The process involved setting up the network configuration for the robot (via Ethernet and Wi-Fi), understanding and implementing motion commands using the pyedo Python library, and developing a fully functional GUI using the Tkinter module.

One of the major accomplishments was automating repetitive pick-and-place cycles and enabling the user to initiate robot actions through a simple interface. Through this project, we enhanced our understanding of robotics programming, robot motion planning, GUI development, and troubleshooting real-time communication between software and robotic hardware. Our solution provides a foundational framework for future students or developers who want to experiment with industrial robot applications using Python. This document provides a complete step-by-step tutorial that allows anyone to replicate the project independently, without needing to refer to outside resources.
